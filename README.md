# Analyzing-the-prices-of-houses
I have built a predictive model which can predict the prices of the houses in a particular location based on the attributes such as number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, the SQFT of the house, the age of the house, if the house is vacant or not, and also number of floors. I have used IBM SPSS for this analysis.
